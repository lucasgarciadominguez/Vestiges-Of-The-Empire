Welcome to the Low Poly Romans Pack! First of all, thanks a lot for purchasing the pack!

You can immediately start with creating your first environment. 
Open the Prefabs folder, take a look at the variety of assets and then start
placing them onto a Terrain!


In order to have results like in the screenshots, I recommend you to use the Post Processing Stack, which
is available for free on the Asset Store (you should consider watching a Youtube Tutorial or reading it's documentation
if you're a beginner)


As you can see, the content is not limited to Rome. Most coexisting cultures have been implemented aswell such as 
the Carthagians, the Greeks, the Persians, the Germanics or the Celts.

 
I hope you have fun creating interesting and beautiful scenes, landscapes, cities, and battles.


If you should have any questions or requests for future updates, feel free to contact us at halberstram.art@gmail.com
Furthermore, If you made a scene that you're really proud of, feel free to share it with us as well! 


Have fun!
